# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

First preview: the `/truequery` skill (build, ask, analyze,
metric, review, harden, init, hooks), the offline checker with 25
checks (15 on by default), the receipt, and Claude Code hooks.

- Files over the 10 MB per-file limit are reported as not checked,
  never as clean.
- Pinned dependencies (`pyyaml==6.0.3`; the demo uses
  `duckdb>=1.1,<2`).
- The receipt is in plain words, and names a limit (integer division;
  dbt, incremental-model and Airflow rules) only when it applies.
- The plugin puts `truequery` on the agent's PATH, so the skill always
  runs the plugin's own checker, never an older install or another `tq`.
- Claude Code: a finding shown right after an edit isn't repeated at the
  end of the turn. Hook messages start with `[TrueQuery]`.
- The plugin runs its own engine as an editable install, so the hooks
  and the agent always run the code in the plugin folder, never a stale
  cached build, even after a reinstall at the same version.
- `truequery check` works as another name for `truequery detect`.
- The checker installs from PyPI: `pip install truequery`
  (or `uv tool install truequery`; no install at all with
  `uvx truequery`).
